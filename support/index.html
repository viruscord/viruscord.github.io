            Please go straight to the point while mentionning or DMing someone for support.

            Between the three scenarios listed under, the first is the worst but is also the one occuring the most.
            the second is preferable but doesn't include the politeness of the thirst.
            Our goal as software makers is of course to help people but please go in detail in your first interaction with us, being polite and using proper grammar is preferable but not completely needed since a lot of people aren't fluid in english and we aren't here to debate on that.
            Being polite, using proper grammar and giving as much info as possible will make the devs/support more likely to help you for a longer period while doing their best.
